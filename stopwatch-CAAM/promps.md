## frist try
Create a page with a Stopwatch function, on this repository https://github.com/yaguarnecro/AI4Devs-stopwatch/tree/5dd65c497bdd0c87e62e28928672f052156a870e/stopwatch-CAAM

the expected functionality is

to click on start button to start a chronometer
the chronometer or watch will show the pass of time
after selecting start the start button will change to a stop button
if the user clicks on the stop button the count will stop and the button will change from stop to continue.
if the user clicks on continue button the count will resume
if the user instead clicks on clear on any moment i will go back to default, chronometer on cero and the start button
for all the visual aspects use for reference this picture
https://github.com/yaguarnecro/AI4Devs-stopwatch/blob/main/res/stopwatch.png
and this page https://www.online-stopwatch.com/large-stopwatch/

the ouput will be expected to be on index-html and script.js use the files on template folder as a reference, also provide comments and follow coding and testing best practices
