### First Prompt 

Hello ChatGPT, I need to build a web application for measure time in hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds and consists in two features, a stopwatch and a countdown, both features will need a pause, continue and clear precise features. Display the hours, minutes and seconds in a row, and the milliseconds right bellow them.

I want a dark thematic, color palette will be from dark to dark grey's, Roboto google font and a yellow color for main header.

App will be named Countdown and Stopwatch. Add it as a title in meta tag and as a header for naming the app.

The solution will be simple, included in three files, an base index.html for displaying the front end, a script.js for manipulating the DOM and calculating all the data and a style.css for styling.

Add documentation in a ReadMe that includes:
* How to run a project with Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
